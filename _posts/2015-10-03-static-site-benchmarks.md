I thought I'd bechmark some of the popular ways to serve static sites online.

The three ways im going to benchmark in this article are

1. AWS S3
2. Github Pages
3. Nginx

The static site I will be testing against is representative of a typical site in production.
A couple of large images, a large css file (bootstrap), and some large javascript (angular).
