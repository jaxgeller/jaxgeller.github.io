I'm Jackson and I'm a developer from DC. I love developing webapps, everything from the front to the back. I'm mostly interested in highly performant web applications on the front-end. _Keep it 16.666666667._

I have a need for speed; I spend a good portion of my days in devtool timelines optimizing every piece of code I can.  If im not doing that, I'm probably checking out Github Trending and HN.

When I'm developing for the front-end I like to use the following tooling

+ Gulp
+ Sass/postcss
+ Babel
+ Browserify
+ Browsersync

And these frameworks

+ Ember.js
+ React.js
+ Vanilla js

In the back-end I'm familiar with

+ Ruby on Rails
+ Node.js
+ docker
+ Nginx
+ AWS/ Digitalocean
+ Debian
